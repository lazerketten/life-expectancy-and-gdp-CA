- Project Title: Life Expectancy and GDP Project 

- Description: This project is an analysis of data from the World Health Organization and the World Bank (obtained through Codecademy). The data contains GDP and life expectancies for 6 countries (China, Chile, Germany, Mexico, US and Zimbabwe) over 16 years (2000-2015). Through analysis, visualizations and hypothesis testing, I sought to answer the following questions:
1. What is the country with the highest (max) GDP?
2. What is the country with the lowest (min) GDP?
3. What country saw the most GDP growth over the 16 years?
4. What country had the highest average GDP (over the 16 years)?
5. What country had the lowest average GDP (over the 16 years)?
6. What country had the highest life expectancy (over the 16 years)?
7. What country had the lowest life expectancy (over the 16 years)?
8. Is GDP correlated with life expectancy?



- Technologies: This project was created using Juypter Notebook for Python.
