Life Expectancy and GDP (portfolio project) NOTES

1. Data Notes
- GDP and life expectancy from the World Health Organization and the World Bank
- Four columns : Country, Year, life expectancy, and GDP
- 6 countries (Chile, China, Germany, Mexico, US, and Zimbabwe
- 16 years (2000-2015)
- One country for each major continent (excluding Australia and Antartica)
- GDP as an exponent, may need to convert for visualizations
--make seperate column in df for this conversion
- Spaces and capitalizations, may need to create a seperate df with lowercase and removed spaces/punctuation?

2. Scope
Qs:
Whats the richest country?
Whats the poorest country?
What country saw the most GDP growth over the 16 years?
What country has the highest avg GDP (over the 16 yrs)?
What country has the lowest avg GDP (over the 16 yrs)?
What country has the highest avg life expec (over the 16 yrs)?
What country has the lowest avg life expec (over the 16 yrs)?
Is GDP correlated with life expectancy?


visuals and calcs:
- simple bar graph comparing GDPs between countries (per year/one year/avg?)
- simple bar graph comparing life expecs between countries (per year/one year/avg?)
- line graph (per country) showing GDP vs Life Expec over the years
--make seperate dataframe for each country
- make a table of avg life expecs and GDP per country
--use that table to calculate statistical correlation between life expec/gdp

3. Analysis/Conclusions
The richest country (the country with the highest max GDP) is the US (1.810000e+13)
The poorest country (the country with the lowest min GDP) is Zimbabwe (4.415703e+09)
The country that saw the most GDP growth over the 16 years was China with 9,853,350,000,000.00
The country with the highest average GDP is the US (1.407500e+13)
The country with the lowest average GDP is Zimbabwe (9.062580e+09)
The country with the highest average life expectancy is Germany with 79.7
The country with the lowest agerage life expectancy is Zimbabwe with 50.1


4. Additional questions
How would the statistics on life expectancy differ between genders within each country?
What is the infant mortality rate for each country, and how does it effect their average life expectancy?
What percentage of GDP is invested in healthcare?
What are statistics on causes of death within each country?
How has any of the information changed in the years (2015 to present) that followed?
